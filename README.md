# BadMail

Personal email software perfect for a student of University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus. It has 2 [https://inbox.google.com](Gmail/Inbox) viewers, the university's [https://moodle.nottingham.ac.uk](Moodle) and [https://email.nottingham.edu.my](Outlook viewer), a [https://keep.google.com](Google Keep) viewer for taking notes and a [https://github.com](GitHub) viewer.

The viewers currently use the `<webview>` element of [https://electron.atom.io](Electron). I plan to use something more dedicated in the releases.

### To-do List

- [x] Added GitHub viewer
- [] Make unresizable view for Mac
- [] Fix frame properties for Mac
